This code uses a reservoir computer to infer network links between coupled Lorenz oscillators from their time-series. The actual code to run is main_code.m. It uses a picture (false.png) to construct the Lorenz network connection pattern from the pixel values and plots the actual and inferred connection patterns side-by-side.
